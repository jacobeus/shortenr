Make your own URL shortener in 3 minutes
========================================

Shortenr is a 14-line web application allowing you to have your own private URL shortener.



Tools/services:

- Sinatra as web framework
- DataMapper as ORM
- Heroku.com for the free hosting
- ZerigoDNS for DNS

Prerequisites:

- A free, properly configured account on Heroku.com
- A (ideally short) domain name, configured to point to Zerigo DNS, as explained on:
  http://www.zerigo.com/docs/managed-dns/nameservers
And to test it locally:
- Ruby
- Some gems: sudo gem install sinatra dm-core dm-validations dm-aggregates do_mysql

Usage:

1) Configure the app on Heroku
git clone http://github.com/njacobeus/shortenr.git
heroku create {name_of_your_shortener}
heroku addons:add custom_domains
heroku domains:add {your_domain_name}
heroku addons:add zerigo_dns
git push heroku master

2) Create the "shortener" database locally and send it to Heroku

Either with Datamapper:

- Add the line "DataMapper.auto_migrate" in shortener.rb
- Launch it once locally (ruby shortener.rb) and stop it
- Remove the line

Or manually in your MySQL client: you only need an "urls" table with the 3 fields (id, target, short) as described in shortener.rb.

Then send it to Heroku:

heroku db:push mysql://root@localhost/shortener

4) Submit URLs to shorten via your "secret" access URL:
  http://{your_domain_name}/_privateshortener?url={url_to_add}
  (you can obviously change that URL to make it a little bit more secret)

4) That's it! Enjoy :)
